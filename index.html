     <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello my name is Aubrey Koller" width="200">
     <p>Hello! My name is Aubrey Koller, and I am from Rexburg, Idaho. I enjoy snowboarding, swimming, hiking, dirt biking, and anything outdoors. I am currently studying business finance at BYU-Idaho. I come from a beautiful blended family with 8 step siblings, 2 biological siblings, and 4 amazing parents. Family is incredibly important to me, and I feel grateful for the unique dynamics and bonds that come with a blended family. One of my passions is Idaho itself; I love its natural beauty and the opportunities it offers for outdoor adventures. After I graduate, I aspire to build a career in financial analytics right here in this beautiful state. Combining my love for finance with the stunning environment of Idaho is a dream I'm eager to pursue. </p>

    <p>Idaho, a northwestern state in the U.S., is renowned for its rugged landscapes, outdoor activities like skiing and hiking, and its capital, Boise, which features a growing tech sector and cultural amenities. Known as the "Gem State" for its natural resources, particularly potatoes, Idaho offers a mix of natural beauty and urban vibrancy.</p>
